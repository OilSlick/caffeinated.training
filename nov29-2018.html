# Heat Transfer

* Thermal Energy
* Heat ≠ Temperature
* Conduction, Convection, Radiation

---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Conductive Transfer

* Physical contact + temperature gradient
* Common cause of roast defects
* Temperature gradient inside bean
* Water content is critical*

---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Convective Transfer

* Air as a medium or vehicle
* Most common transfer method in drum and air roasters
* Greater the temp difference between air and bean greater the transfer (potential)

---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Radiated Transfer

* Electromagnetic radiation (same as the sun)
* Some visible, some not
* Example: light from heat source, heat felt near a heat source
* Metal in roaster acts as a battery, storing energy as heat*

# Temperature Midway Point ≈ 75 Agtron

* New concept
* Generates easy color to work/train with
* Not meant to be a standard or a sweet spot regarding end product

# Quick Review

1. What are the three types of heat transfer?
2. Why is water content important?
3. What is the difference between heat and temperature?

# The Roasting Cycle

* Evaporation
* Color VS roast curves
* Defects
* Cooling Time

---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Drying

* Primary concern of first-third of roast (first phase)
* Evaporative cooling 

---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Roasting

* Maillard reaction (complex)
* Streker degradation (complex)
* Melanoidins
* Organic acids

.center[Much more on this tomorrow]
---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Rate of Change

* Often called Rate of Rise (but rate may not always rise)
* Speed (momentum) of the roast
* Typically measured in 30 or 60-second intervals
* Not useful until after TP
* 30s is more accurate than 60s calculations

---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Rate of Change

Example:  
At 4:00 temp is 148°C  
At 4:30 temp is 153°C

The temperature increased 5° in thirty seconds

153° - 148° = 5°

Therefore, RoC is 5°/30s  

Or if we want a more accurate/higher resolution RoC we could calculate the rate of change per second:

153° - 148° = 5°  
Time = 30s

5/30 = .16°/s (not very useful, in my opinion)

# Cooling

* Preferably within 4 minutes
* Ideally as fast as possible
* Quenching with water can be bad (but can be done)

---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Quick Review

* How much mass is typically lost during the roast and what is most of the ‘material’ that is lost?
* Which occurs first (and thus longest); Strecker degradation or the Maillard reactions?
* Why are darker roasts less acidic?

# Basic properties and changes

* Coffee is organic!
* Endothermic VS exothermic reactions

Important changes to observe and measure:

* Temperature over time
* Volume
* Weight
* Color
* Density

# Temperature over time

* Temperature evolution
* Typically includes bean and air or environment temp  (BT & ET)
* Momentum (Rate of change or rate of rise)
 
---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Volume Changes

* Cell walls become brittle
* Water vapor inside bean creates a vapor “wall”*
* CO2 build-up
* Other organic gasses

---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Weight Changes

* Weight difference is a critical measurement
* Weigh coffee before and after roasting and calculate % weight loss
* Density change is also a good measurement to track consistency

---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Color changes

* Sugar browning
* Melanoidins
* Industry standards for color measurement

---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Sugar Changes

* Simple sugars already present in green bean
* Broken down and used later to form polysaccharides
* Caramelization
* Maillard VS Caramelization

---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Acidity Changes

* Acids created early in roast
* Get reduced later in roast
* Therefore acidity provides information on roast level

More on acids tomorrow!]

# Workspace Management

Green coffee storage, ideal conditions:

* 60% relative humidity
* Green beans at 10-12% moisture content  (12% = longest shelf life with 60% relative humidity)
* Keep bags ~15cm off floor, away from pests, water, etc
* Consider GoPro bags (can be expensive)
* Routinely check and monitor condition of stored greens

---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Workspace Management

Ideal safety conditions
* Production flow
  * Efficiency, organization in layout & movement
  * Physical safety/health (heavy lifting)
* Air quality while roasting
  * Big roasting machine (20+Kg) consider a mask
  * When handling greens consider a mask
  * Not just gases, but micro-fibers & micro-particles from greens 
* Fire safety
 * Fire suppression
 * Plan for a roaster fire
 * Share the plan with everyone
 * Revisit the plan regularly (at least yearly)

---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Roaster Machine Construction

* Drum roaster
* Fluid bed
* Batch VS continuous roaster

---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Ventilation

* Within the drum, ventilation creates convection heat transfer
* Keep the exhaust stack clean to avoid fires!
* Ensure dangerous gases are evacuated from facility 

---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Electricity

* Electric roasters are fine for sample roasting or lab roasting.
* Electrical heating elements are slow and don’t scale well

Question: how would you compensate for the lag caused by an electrical heating element?

---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Tools for roasting

* Buckets + shovel/scoop
* Logging sheets or software
* Timer and temperature probes
* Infrared thermometer can be helpful
* Moisture, density, and roast color meters are handy  (and getting cheaper and smaller)
* Quality Control System (what does this look like?)
*A roaster (obviously)

---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Cleaning, Maintenance, & Troubleshooting

* Ventilation ducts
* Chaff collector
* Exhaust air cleaning
* Cooling tray
* Area surrounding roaster

---
.logo[![OSC logo](/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Tomorrow

We’ll meet in the cupping lab

We’re cupping immediately after a quick meeting
* No perfumes, colognes or heavy fragrances
* Be done smoking in time for your clothes to air-out

# Roasting Activity: 5 Roasts

Roast 1: Perform roast with any profile to Temperature Midway Point (sample color creation).

Roast 2: Perform roast with similar profile to Midway Point of Roast 1 but continue to the start of 2nd Crack (and thereby resulting in a longer development time).

Roast 3: Roast coffee to the same profile to First Crack, then end at the same color with a longer development time (over 4 mins).

Roast 4: Roast coffee to the same profile to First Crack, then end at the same color with a shorter development time (under 1:30).

Roast 5: Roast coffee to the same profile to First Crack, then end at the same color with a 2-3 minute development time.
