There were multiple whiteboards for the Intermediate course held on February 27th, 2019.

In the <a data-fancybox="gallery" data-selectable="true" href="/images/5758-feb-team-whiteboard.jpeg">team whiteboard</a> you can see a good example of a "slow and low" roast from team 2's (T2) first roast and the color results it produces; a narrow difference between whole color (whole co.) and ground color (ground co.). Compare that to the roasts produced by team 1 (T1), which have a larger difference (diff) between whole and ground colors. The sensory characteristics of these two roasts was easily detectable. 

Also note that in the <a data-fancybox="gallery" data-selectable="true" href="/images/5758-feb-26-whiteboard.jpeg">Foundation whiteboard</a>, I used incorrect (unrealistic) Agtron values when illustrating the color differences inside a bean. The numbers should be reversed: the outside of the bean would be darker, with a *lower* Ag number and the inside of the bean would be lighter, with a *higher* Ag number. Damn you Agtron with your backwards scale! ãƒ„

Below are links to each whiteboard image:
