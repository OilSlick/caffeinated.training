Genes are incredibly important but traits are also heavily influenced by the environment! 

Three papers focus on our three key concpets

First filial generation (F1)

Simply; the first generation from a planned cross.

For seed production; often use inbred lines.

Key advantage: hybrid vigor (heterosis)

*The whole is greater than the sum of the parts*

## True breeds

???
A simplified overview; a single locus for a specific trait in a diploid organism.

Arabica = tetraploid, Robusta = diploid

Genetics = a game of probability

This is just one method; another is selfing, which increases homozygosity. 

Homozygous at given locus = "fixed"

Paul McCartney is great, but The Beatles were better!

<blockquote>In plant and animal breeding, desired <b>heterotic characteristics are quantitative</b>; that is, the underlying genes contribute incrementally to the traits of interest and often have interactive effects. This is in contrast to Mendelian genes whose alleles specify clear, alternative traits. Heterotic traits that are important in plant and animal agriculture include <b>enhanced seed or biomass production (yield), seed composition, growth rate, stature</b>, meat composition, litter size, and <b><font color="green">stress tolerance</font></b>.[emphasis added]</blockquote>

HARMONY

Hybrid vigor = heterosis

Heterotic characteristics = quantitative! üëà the magic sauce of F1 hybrids

Stress tolerance = pest, disease, drought, etc! The paper G X E demonstrated hybrid superiority

Selfing increases probablity of fixed lines of AA & aa (homozygous for a given trait)

Inbreed depression = accumulation of homozygous loci and a loss of heterosis

Crossing is also a way to reduce the accumulation of detrimental alleles

Think about rust resistance: dominant trait, but with several gens of selfing = higher probability of loss of resistance

By generation 5, could be as high as 46% chance of homozygous, recessive locus. (diploid, of-course)

CIR-SM01, an Ethiopian accession found in germplasm in Costa Rica

Bonus: male-sterility for CIR-SM01 Is hereditable! = a stable trait

All fruit borne by CIR-SM01 guaranteed from a cross and not from selfing.

# Putting it all together
---
# F1 hybrids are generally: 

* More likely to be climate-adaptable
* More likely to have higher yield
* More likely to be pest- and disease-resistant

And most importantly:

* More likely to help improve the livelihood of the smallholder farmer!
???
One of the key benefits of Starmaya: advancing the **technology frontier** for Indo coffee

What tech can be efficiently/effectively used

One reason technology not adapted by a country: little capacity to implement it
* Tech transfer without knowledge transfer = FAIL
* When lacking **factor endowment**
---
# F1s + Seed gardens help increase  capacity

.middle[
* Inexpensive method for mass propagation of F1 hybrids!
* Democratizing elite plant stock (potentially)
* Knowledge and technology transfer (F1 hybrids, their benefits, deployment, etc)
* Local seed production systems
* Empower the farmer by improving decision-making abilities (informed decisions)
