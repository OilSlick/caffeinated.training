# Workshop objectives

* Share with attendees how coffee professionals evaluate coffee through the process of cupping.
* Explore some of the ways one can train for sensory analysis of coffee
* Learn about and expore how to objectively describe and descriminate aroma, taste, and body in coffees

# What *is* sensory analysis?

---
class: middle
# What is sensory analysis? 

"A scientific discipline that evokes, measures, analyses and interprets reactions to those characteristics of foods and materials as they are perceived by the senses of sight, smell, taste, touch and hearing

"It relies on trained and regular tasters, standardised preparation protocol and test design, decisions, and rules."

???
Intentionally experiencing something using the five senses: of sight, smell, taste, touch and hearing. Using our bodies like a measurement instrument. Structured, protocol, ritualistic.

Communication

Decision making 

???
ID defects/taints, ID pleasant flavors and their quality, evaluate intensity, creates an overall picture of the product
---
class: middle

Communication

* What specifications need to be in place with partners?
* How different are my products?
* How do I compare to competition?
* How should I promote and market products?

Decision making

* What to purchase/launch?
* How to roast/brew?
* What to add/discontinue/improve?
 
---
class: middle

# How can we use sensory analysis specifically in coffee?

--

* Purchasing decisions
* Quality control and quality assurance
* Blending and brewing practices
* Product mapping
* Consumer testing

???
Cupping can help inform a decision as to which brew method emphasizes a given, desirable flavor. Can inform blending decisions (such as what to replace a given coffee with). Can help keep a product flavor consistent.

# Why not just use *informal* sensory analysis

--

Wasted time

Miscommunication

Missed goals

\*Remember: sensory analysis is a *standardized* process. For consistency, we always cup coffee following a process.

# How we experience coffee

Flavor = Aroma + Taste

Body (mouthfeel)

Color (appearance)

\+ Environment!

???
Environment influences our perception. Drinking a coffee near a landfill VS near the Danube.

# Physiology

.center[<img src="/images/ortho-retronasal.gif">]

"Smell is the one sensory modality that does not synapse in the thalamus before connecting to the cerebral cortex. This intimate connection between the olfactory system and the cerebral cortex is one reason why smell can be a potent trigger of memories and emotion."

.footnote[
https://opentextbc.ca/anatomyandphysiology/chapter/14-1-sensory-perception/]

???
Direct link to the brain. Most important sensation for flavor.
OB = Olfactory bulb
OFC = Orbito-Frontal Cortex

New flavors compared to known flavors

Flavor preferences developed in childhood

…but continue to develop throughout life!

_\*Strive to challenge and develop your palate over time!_

#World Coffee Research Lexicon

The terms used in the new flavor wheel come from the WCR lexicon.

**Descriptive**
* No “good” or “bad” attributes (unbiased)
* Not for ranking coffee
* Purely descriptive

**Quantifiable**
* Uses an intensity scale of 1 - 15
* Allows for easy comparison of two or more coffees

**Replicable**
* When used properly, tasters from all over the world will experience and describe the same coffee the same way
