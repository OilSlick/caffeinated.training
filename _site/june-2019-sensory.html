# What is sensory analysis? 

"A scientific discipline that evokes, measures, analyses and interprets reactions to those characteristics of foods and materials as they are perceived by the senses of sight, smell, taste, touch and hearing

"It relies on trained and regular tasters, standardised preparation protocol and test design, decisions, and rules."

???
Intentionally experiencing something using the five senses: of sight, smell, taste, touch and hearing. Using our bodies like a measurement instrument. Structured, protocol, ritualistic.

# How can we use sensory analysis specifically in coffee?

--

* Purchasing decisions
* Quality control and quality assurance
* Blending and brewing practices
* Product mapping
* Consumer testing

???
Cupping can help inform a decision as to which brew method emphasizes a given, desirable flavor. Can inform blending decisions (such as what to replace a given coffee with). Can help keep a product flavor consistent.
---
# Why not just use *informal* sensory analysis

--

* Wasted time

* Miscommunication

* Missed goals

\*Remember: sensory analysis is a *standardized* process. For consistency, we always cup coffee following a process.

# How we experience coffee

Flavor = Aroma + Taste

Body (mouthfeel)

Color (appearance)

\+ Environment!

???
Environment influences our perception. Drinking a coffee near a landfill VS near the Danube.

# Activity: Distinquish between taste and smell

# Physiology

.center[<img src="/images/ortho-retronasal.gif">]

"Smell is the one sensory modality that does not synapse in the thalamus before connecting to the cerebral cortex. This intimate connection between the olfactory system and the cerebral cortex is one reason why smell can be a potent trigger of memories and emotion."

.footnote[
https://opentextbc.ca/anatomyandphysiology/chapter/14-1-sensory-perception/]

???
Direct link to the brain. Most important sensation for flavor.
OB = Olfactory bulb
OFC = Orbito-Frontal Cortex
---
# Physiology

.center[<img src="/images/ortho-retronasal.gif">]

"We often characterize our food in terms of how it ‚Äútastes,‚Äù but the sense of taste as properly defined consists of sensitivity only to sweet, salt, sour, bitter, and umami."

.footnote[
Gordon Shepherd in his book Neurogastronomy: How the Brain Creates Flavor and Why It Matters]
???
Retronasal is especially important 

Smell dominates flavor
---
# Speaking of the üß†

* Humans have a very large brain (for complex processing)
* Big brains = complex systems
* Systems like memory, emotion, higher cognitive processing, *language*
* All give us the human brain flavor system*

# What does this mean?

1. If there is no retronasal breathing (breathing out), we don't effectively detect smell or flavor
2. The ability to identify or classify the flavor such as chocolate or lemon is attributable to the sense of smell
3. Our perception of retronasal smell is usually combined with taste and touch data so that we are unaware of it *as a smell*
4. We have just proved that smell is the major component of flavor.

# Basic tastes

*Page 6 of your handout*

# Taste - Five Basics

Sweet

Sour

Salty

Bitter

Umami
???
Simple tastes are hardwired from birth, whereas retronasal smells are learned and thus open to individual differences.

# Flavor preferences are cultural

Flavor memory-bank

New flavors compared to known flavors

Flavor preferences developed in childhood

‚Ä¶but continue to develop throughout life!

_\*Strive to challenge and develop your palate over time!_
???
Because new flavors are compared to known flavors, it's important to have a well-stocked flavor library

Becoming a good taster means tasting a lot

Be intentional as you eat and drink food. 

Use the buddy system!

# Basic Aromas

???
Remember the importance of retronasal smell to the perception of flavor

Also remember we compare new flavors to known flavors

Lastly remember that flavor preferences and our early flavor memory bank is *cultural*

## üå∏ üçã üçì üçë üçé üçè

* Reminiscent of products formed in nature via enzymatic reactions.

* Formation of flavors in green coffee beans is a field of active research

* Composed of esters and aldehydes

--

**Esters**

* Alcohols and acids that contribute to fruity & floral aromas- ie: apricot, lemon

**Aldehydes**

* Organic compounds  Components of green coffee Ie: herbal, orange

#Sugar Browning Flavors and Aromas

--

## üç´ ü•ú üç™ ü•ñ üåæ

Result of Maillard reaction and sugar-browning process

Composed of aldehydes, ketones, sugar, carbonyl and pyrazine compounds

Comprises most of the flavors commonly associated with coffee

--

## üå≤ üî• üö¨ 

Generated late in the roasting process, at high temps

Usually associated with a dark roast level

Dry distillation process: Solid is heated to a high temperature and turns into gas, which is then often condensed and collected as a liquid

Not proven to happen in coffee roasting process, but is used to describe aromas

#Defects

#World Coffee Research Lexicon

The terms used in the new flavor wheel come from the WCR lexicon.

**Descriptive**
* No ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù attributes (unbiased)
* Not for ranking coffee
* Purely descriptive

**Quantifiable**
* Uses an intensity scale of 1 - 15
* Allows for easy comparison of two or more coffees

**Replicable**
* When used properly, tasters from all over the world will experience and describe the same coffee the same way
