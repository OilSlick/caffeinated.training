# Three Burner Types

Atmospheric burner (gas burner)  
Electric burner (like toaster oven)  
Infrared burner (ceramic plates in BBQ grill)

???
Electrical burners possible on small (batch size 12 and less) roasters. 
Electrical heating elements are slow but are fine for roasting. 

Electricity always drives motors and general control circuits.

# Heat Transfer Methods

Convective  
Conductive  
Radiative

Related:

Endothermic  
Exothermic

???
Two most common: convective and conductive. 
Convective involves moving air. 
Conductive requires physical contact and a temperature gradient. Drum rotation important here

Radiated heat example: the light emitted from a red-hot heating element in a toaster

Keywords:
Convection
Conduction
Endothermic
Exothermic

# Roasting Plant Safety

**Three areas of concern:**

Fire  

Ventilation  

Personal safety  

* Create an emergency plan ahead of time
* Discuss the plan with everyone 
* Create a cleaning + maintenance plan
* Regularly review procedures and plans

???
Given a long enough timeline, everyone will experience a fire. 

Personal safety examples: loading coffee (heavy weight over head, maybe on stool, etc)

Smoke in roasting (ventilation, as smoke does escape the roaster into the room)

Personal hazard areas:

	Green coffee storage

	Roasting

	Packaging, production

	shipping

Keywords:

Airflow, chimney

Chaff. Chaff collector

Fire extinguisher (water vs. CO2)

Fire in the chimney

Fire in the drum

Stirring device/agitator/cooling bin (long, draping clothes)

# Roaster fires

1. Shut off gas (or element if electric)
2. Keep drum rotating
3. Don’t open roaster doors
4. Don’t eject beans

---

# Personal Safety Concerns

**Four areas of concern:**

* Green coffee storage
* Roasting
* Packaging, production
* Shipping

What are some concerns in these areas?

---
.logo[![OSC logo](https://oilslick.github.io/caffeinated.training/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Fire Classifications

* Class A  
Ordinary items (wood, paper, plastic, rags)
* Class B  
Flammable Liquids
* Class C  
Electrical equipment

---
.logo[![OSC logo](https://oilslick.github.io/caffeinated.training/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Roaster Cleaning & Maintenance

* Remove chaff often (fuel source for fire)
  * Know where chaff collects in your roaster
  * At least daily, more for “chaffy” beans
* Keep ducts clear/clean (creosote & chaff)
* Keep moving parts lubricated (food grade grease)
* Follow manufacturer’s manual and recommendations

# Physical changes in the bean

* Dries out
* Progressively darkens
* Becomes increasingly brittle
* First Crack
* Size can increase 30 - 100%
* Second crack
* Eventually oil seeps out (especially beyond second crack)
* Sometimes get divots (can be a roast defect)
* Rapid cooling (≤ 4min) to halt chemical reactions (changes)

# First Crack and Second Crack

* Every *successful* roast has a first crack
* First crack is the result of rapid release of pent-up vapor/steam pressure and CO2
* Not all roasts reach second crack (operator’s preference)
* Exothermic flashes as escaping heat affects environment

# Roast Data

Measurements that can be collected from green and roasted coffee:

1. Green: batch weight
2. Green: bulk density
3. Green: volume
4. Green: screen size
5. Green: moisture content (acceptable range for Specialty?)
6. Roasted: color
7. Roasted: weight\* 
8. Roasted: bulk density\*
9. Roasted: volume\*


Cupping data should be associated with roast profile for post-roast analysis.

\*Calculate percent changes for these attributes]

# Label the following on a typical roast profile

Charge  
Turning Point  
Color change: green to yellow  
First crack  
Second crack  
Roast End

# Roast Progression

* Lighter roasts highlight (preserve) acidity, enzymatic flavors/aromas

* Darker roasts emphasize chocolatey, nutty, bitter flavors/aromas

---

# Temperature Midway Point ≈ 75 Agtron

* New concept  
* Generates easy color to work/train with  
* Not meant to be a standard or a sweet spot regarding end product
