#Organic Acids in Coffee

Citric - Present in green coffee, pleasant floral flavors indicative of citrus fruit

Malic - Tastes like green apples

Lactic - The acid present in milk (i.e. very mild)

Chlorogenic acid - 

<BR><BR><BR>Coffee pH ≈ 5

Neutral pH = 7.0

#Acids in Coffee

* Organic acids are early products of plant metabolism 
* Also are produced through degradation of more reduced chemical entities in plants

Put simply:

* Photosynthesis produces sugars, which are converted to energy. In the conversion process, organic acids are produced as by-products.

Put even more simply:

* In order for plants to form acids, they must have sugars. 

???
Acids contribute a hydrogen ion, lowering pH.

Phosphoric acid is inorganic and requires a phosphate from the soil

#Acids in Coffee

Other sources of acids in coffee

* Coffee plant/development → photosynthesis
* Processing → fermentation = acetic acids
* Roasting → Maillard reaction
* Brewing?

???
"Given the same roast level, coffees brewed at higher temperatures will exhibit higher extractable solubles, higher concentrations of total acids, and lower pH values." 

"Since acids are water soluble, increases to water temperature produce higher levels of extraction"

The more time the coffee sits, the more acidic it will become

Higher acidity generally means higher cupping score

#Acids in Coffee - Roasting

Roasting coffee beans creates a temperature gradient in the bean

Acetic acid is formed by the breakdown of sugars. Other acids are formed by the breakdown of other pre-existing compounds. 

Heat accelerates chemical reactions and in this case the formation of acids.

Larger gradients therefore provide a greater difference in acid development with the beans. 

Put simply: faster + hotter roast = greater difference between ground and whole color = more complex acidity

???
Draw bean and indicate heat on outer edges and temp + acid degradation gradients

#Acids in Coffee

Citric and malic acids decompose at relatively high temps 176°C and 190°C respectively

Both are 'tart' but malic is smoother than citric. 

Malic acid tends to be highly favored by coffee professionals when scoring a coffee.*

#Malic Acid

* High concentration in apples
* Perceived sourness—sensation on the sides of the tongue
* Formed by plant before cherry harvest
* Regional humidity for plant increases acidity in cherry
* Generally, more fruitiness (as with wine) = more malic acid
* Typical medium roast will lose ~30% or original malic acid content

---
#Acetic Acid

* Vinegar
* Mostly formed during roasting process
* Also a by-product of fermentation
* Can increase up to 25 times from initial green bean content
* Formed by breakdown of carbs (sugar) — therefore more prevalent in arabica VS robusta
* Volatile - therefore readily detected by smell

???
Due to volatility, plays an important role in aroma.

Acetic acid levels peak at light-roast level and rapidly decreases with darker roasts. 

---
#Phosphoric Acid

* Inorganic (lacks available carbon)
* Formed by plant before cherry harvest
* 100 times more potent than most of organic acids

"[M]any researchers believe that phosphoric acid significantly contributes to beverage acidity due to its strength and ability to readily dissociate.*"
