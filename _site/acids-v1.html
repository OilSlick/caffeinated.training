#Organic Acids in Coffee

Citric - Present in green coffee, pleasant floral flavors indicative of citrus fruit

Malic - Tastes like green apples

Lactic - The acid present in milk (i.e. very mild)

Phosphoric - Bubbles in soda. More of a sensation than a taste

<BR><BR><BR>Coffee pH ≈ 5

Neutral pH = 7.0

#Acids in Coffee

* Organic acids are early products of plant metabolism 
* Also are produced through degradation of more reduced chemical entities in plants

Put simply:

* Photosynthesis produces sugars, which are converted to energy. In the conversion process, organic acids are produced as by-products.

Put even more simply:

* In order for plants to form acids, they must have sugars. 

???
Acids contribute a hydrogen ion, lowering pH.

Phosphoric acid is inorganic and requires a phosphate from the soil

#Acids in Coffee

Other sources of acids in coffee

* Coffee plant/development → photosynthesis
* Processing → fermentation = acetic acids
* Roasting → Maillard reaction
* Brewing

???
"Given the same roast level, coffees brewed at higher temperatures will exhibit higher extractable solubles, higher concentrations of total acids, and lower pH values." 

"Since acids are water soluble, increases to water temperature produce higher levels of extraction"

The more time the coffee sits, the more acidic it will become

Higher acidity generally means higher cupping score

#Acids in Coffee - Roasting

Roasting coffee beans creates a temperature gradient in the bean

Acetic acid is formed by the breakdown of sugars. Other acids are formed by the breakdown of other pre-existing compounds. 

Heat accelerates chemical reactions and in this case the formation of acids.

Larger gradients therefore provide a greater difference in acid development with the beans. 

Put simply: faster + hotter roast = greater difference between ground and whole color = more complex acidity

???
Draw bean and indicate heat on outer edges and temp + acid degradation gradients

#Acids in Coffee

Citric and malic acids decompose at relatively high temps 176°C and 190°C respectively

Both are 'tart' but malic is smoother than citric. 

Malic acid tends to be highly favored by coffee professionals when scoring a coffee.*
