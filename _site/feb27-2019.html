# Heat Transfer

* Thermal Energy
* Heat ≠ Temperature
* Three types we're concerned with:
 * Conduction
 * Convection
 * Radiation

???
Heat is thermal energy inside a material. 

Heat always travels from hot to cold materials. 

Heat can be transferred by different methods and different methods affects the beans differently 

Heat is thermal energy, temperature is a measure of heat

---
.left-column[
 ## Conductive 
]
.right-column[
* Physical contact + temperature gradient
* Common cause of roast defects
* Temperature gradient inside bean
* Water content is critical*
]

???
Conduction is when materials touch each other and the heat diffuses from the hotter to the cooler body. 

Once the heat reaches the surface of the bean it is transferred inside bean by diffusing from the hotter surface to the colder center which could lead to colour gradient inside bean 

Identify burned spots on coffee as marks of too aggressive contact heat transfer 

Water content is critical for conductive transfer. Too little water = too little heat conducted to inside bean. Less water = less steam = less pressure = lower intensity FC.
---
.left-column[
 ## Conductive
 ## Convective
]
.right-column[
* Air as a medium or vehicle
* Most common transfer method in drum and air roasters
* Greater the temp difference between air and bean greater the transfer (potential)
* Three ways to control convection:
1. Change rate of airflow 
2. Change energy output of burner/element
3. Combination of both
]
???
Convection is thermal energy transfer by means of hot air. 

It is a special kind of contact heat transfer since heat is transferred when the hot air touch/is in contact with the colder bean. 

The magnitude of temperature difference between then air between the beans and the beans themselves is the magnitude of convection heat transfer at any given stage of the roast 
---
.left-column[
 ## Conductive
 ## Convective
 ## Radiated
]
.right-column[
* Electromagnetic radiation (same as the sun)
* Some visible, some not
* Example: light from heat source, heat felt near a heat source
* Metal in roaster acts as a battery, storing energy as heat*
]
???
Radiation is electromagnetic rays that naturally is emitted from a heat source and converted into thermal energy in the material it reaches. It is the same radiation as sun light 

Radiation is not completely converted into thermal energy at the surface of the bean but there is an absorption gradient in the bean so some heat is added inside the bean without affecting the surface

# Heat Transfer, Supplemental

## Total Energy

1. Coffee roasting is a dynamic process that changes throughout the course of the roast.
2. There is infinitely more energy later in the process than earlier.
3. None of the forms of heat transfer are independent of one another.

.footnote[

# Coffee roasting is dynamic
## Dominant heat sources by roasting phase

1. Drum, Air, Bean
2. Air, Drum, Bean
3. Bean, Drum, Air

.footnote[
Terry Davis, "The Heat is On, A Roaster's Guide To Heat Transfer," Roast Magazine May/June 2009]

???
None of the heat transfer forms are independent of one-another.

While it’s difficult to control any single form, it is very useful to know which method is dominate at which stage of the roast.

ET drives BT

There is infinitely more heat available at the end of the roast.

---
# Drum, Air, Bean

* Stored energy is critical here
 * Energy stored in metal parts
 * ...especially the drum
 * High potential for roast defects (scorching, tipping, uneven roast, etc)
* How can we control the temp here?

.footnote[
Terry Davis, "The Heat is On, A Roaster's Guide To Heat Transfer," Roast Magazine May/June 2009]

???
Once the roast begins, very little ability to control conduction

However, during preheat, the operator can set the stage

Higher charge temp = more potential energy stored as heat

Longer/more thorough preheat = more potential energy stored as heat

BT/ET/XT all indicate air temp before roast begins. Airtemp is affected by stored heat as well as burner/element.

Remember with partial/smaller batches to reduce the charge temp!

---
# Air, Drum, Bean

* Air is always dominate form
* However, during the second phase we control the Maillard reaction rate via air temp
 * (Maillard reaction rate increases with more heat)
* Convection is the easiest transfer method for operators to control

.footnote[
Terry Davis, "The Heat is On, A Roaster's Guide To Heat Transfer," Roast Magazine May/June 2009]
---
# Bean, Drum, Air

* In the third phase (beginnning with FC)  the beans become exothermic
 * Can become dominant form of heat transfer
 * How can one maintain control here?

Symptoms of too much heat at first crack:

0. Higher than normal* RoC 
1. Uneven roasting (too much momentum)
2. Unusual amounts of smoke 
3. Little to no pause between FC and SC

.footnote[
Terry Davis, "The Heat is On, A Roaster's Guide To Heat Transfer," Roast Magazine May/June 2009]

???
Anticipating exothermic conditions and reducing power early

Increasing airflow may help reduce momentum here

Boot has in the past recommended increasing heat here. Is that really controlling it or just adding to it?

Also remember that the harder we push the beans towards the end, the harder our cooler must work to cool the beans upon eject. The beans can continue to roast in the cooling tray.

# Temperature Midway Point ≈ 75 Agtron

# Quick Review

1. What are the three types of heat transfer?
2. Why is water content important?
3. What is the difference between heat and temperature?

---

# The Roasting Cycle

* Evaporation
* Color VS roast curves
* Defects
* Cooling Time

???
Evaporation takes heat energy to proceed. Pyrolysis creates heat energy. 

Up to **13-22%** mass lost during roast; most of the starting moisture. 

Even if the same coffee is roasted to the same roast colour you can get very different sensorial results if the shape and timing in the roast profile is different. 

Roasting 'Defects' are worst case deviation from 'nice' profile. Cooling time should practically be as short as possible 

Discuss aspects of roast defects (scorched, baked, underdeveloped)

---

# Drying

* Primary concern of first-third of roast (first phase)
* Evaporative cooling 

???
Moisture leaves the beans during drying and goes from bean to the air between the beans that will become moist and get a higher specific heat capacity. 

“materials with large heat capacities, like water, hold heat well - their temperature won't rise much for a given amount of heat - whereas materials with small heat capacities, like copper, don't hold heat well - their temperature will rise significantly when heat is added” http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/mod_tech/node73.html

Temperatures are held low by evaporating water because evaporation is an endothermic process. 

---

# Roasting

* Maillard reaction (complex)
* Streker degradation (complex)
* Melanoidins
* Organic acids

.center[Much more on this tomorrow]

???
Water is a heat sink—energy used to boil it could be used to roast coffee. 

The Mailliard reaction and Strecker degradation are the main contributors to CO2 formation. ↑CO2 = ↑internal bean pressure

Organic acids are broken down during the roast, especially in later phases
---

# Rate of Change

* Often called Rate of Rise (but rate may not always rise)
* Speed (momentum) of the roast
* Typically measured in 30 or 60-second intervals
* Not useful until after TP
* 30s is more accurate than 60s calculations

???
Changes to RoC are more quickly obvious than changes to BT

With Artisan, prior to version 1.0, RoC was a tool for post-roast analysis. Current versions make it more tactically useful.
---

# Calculating Rate of Change

Example:  
At 4:00 temp is 148°C  
At 4:30 temp is 153°C

The temperature increased 5° in thirty seconds

153° - 148° = 5°

Therefore, RoC is 5°/30s  

Or if we want a more accurate/higher resolution RoC we could calculate the rate of change per second:

153° - 148° = 5°  
Time = 30s

5/30 = .16°/s (not very useful, in my opinion)

# Cooling

* Preferably within 4 minutes
* Ideally as fast as possible
* Quenching with water can be bad (but can be done)

---

# Quick Review

* How much mass is typically lost during the roast and what is most of the ‘material’ that is lost?
* Which occurs first (and thus longest); Strecker degradation or the Maillard reactions?
* Why are darker roasts less acidic?

---

# Basic properties and changes

* Coffee is organic!
* Endothermic VS exothermic reactions

Important changes to observe and measure:

* Temperature over time
* Volume
* Weight
* Color
* Density

---
class: center, middle

#Activity: Visual ID Roast Stages

---

# Temperature over time

* Temperature evolution
* Typically includes bean and air or environment temp  (BT & ET)
* Momentum (Rate of change or rate of rise)
???
A roast profile is a graph showing temperature evolution over time typically for Bean and Air temperature. 
 
---

# Volume Changes

* Cell walls become brittle
* Water vapor inside bean creates a vapor “wall”*
* CO2 build-up
* Other organic gasses
???
Volume increases due to material gets soft when heated combined with water evaporating into steam and pyrolysis creates organic gasses + CO2. 

A pressure is build-up by the evaporating water that will later be the primary driver of bean swelling. If this part is too slow (too low flame) the gas would leak before creating a pressure high enough to expand the bean and the coffee will be 'underdeveloped'. 

If this part is too quick (too high flame) the surface of the bean will be scorched. 

Beans can swell to 30 - 100% in size
---

# Weight Changes

* Weight difference is a critical measurement
* Weigh coffee before and after roasting and calculate % weight loss
* Density change is also a good measurement to track consistency
???
Water in form of vapour and organic material is lost when converted into gas that leaves the material 
---

# Color changes

* Sugar browning
* Melanoidins
* Industry standards for color measurement
???
The product of Maillard reaction (melanoidins) is brown and happens quickly after drying is finished slightly above 100° Celsius. 

Know different industry standards for measuring colour. 

Discuss color meters and how they work (emitting light and evaluating/measuring the wavelength of reflected light)

Some measure wavelength as well as reflection intensity 

Browning starts at 140°C

---

# Sugar Changes

* Simple sugars already present in green bean
* Broken down and used later to form polysaccharides
* Caramelization
* Maillard VS Caramelization
???
Caramelization happens at high temperature (closer to 200° Celsius) so the Maillard reaction is much more pronounced due to it's lower activation temperature 
---

# Acidity Changes

* Acids created early in roast
* Get reduced later in roast
* Therefore acidity provides information on roast level

.center[
More on acids tomorrow!]
???
Acids are created very early in the process but starts to get reduced when entering into commercially relevant roast degrees 

---

# Workspace Management

Green coffee storage, ideal conditions:

* 60% relative humidity
* Green beans at 10-12% moisture content  (12% = longest shelf life with 60% relative humidity)
* Keep bags ~15cm off floor, away from pests, water, etc
* Consider GoPro bags (can be expensive)
* Routinely check and monitor condition of stored greens

---

# Workspace Management

Ideal safety conditions
* Production flow
  * Efficiency, organization in layout & movement
  * Physical safety/health (heavy lifting)
* Air quality while roasting
  * Big roasting machine (20+Kg) consider a mask
  * When handling greens consider a mask
  * Not just gases, but micro-fibers & micro-particles from greens 
* Fire safety
 * Fire suppression
 * Plan for a roaster fire
 * Share the plan with everyone
 * Revisit the plan regularly (at least yearly)

---

# Roaster Machine Construction

* Drum roaster
* Fluid bed
* Batch VS continuous roaster

---

# Ventilation

* Within the drum, ventilation creates convection heat transfer
* Keep the exhaust stack clean to avoid fires!
* Ensure dangerous gases are evacuated from facility 

---

# Electricity

* Electric roasters are fine for sample roasting or lab roasting.
* Electrical heating elements are slow and don’t scale well

Question: how would you compensate for the lag caused by an electrical heating element?

---

# Tools for roasting

* Buckets + shovel/scoop
* Logging sheets or software
* Timer and temperature probes
* Infrared thermometer can be helpful
* Moisture, density, and roast color meters are handy  (and getting cheaper and smaller)
* Quality Control System (what does this look like?)
*A roaster (obviously)

---

# Cleaning, Maintenance, & Troubleshooting

* Ventilation ducts
* Chaff collector
* Exhaust air cleaning
* Cooling tray
* Area surrounding roaster

---

# Tomorrow

We’ll meet in the cupping lab

We’re cupping immediately after a quick meeting
* No perfumes, colognes or heavy fragrances
* Be done smoking in time for your clothes to air-out

# Roasting Activity: 5 Roasts

Roast 1: Perform roast with any profile to Temperature Midway Point (sample color creation).

Roast 2: Perform roast with similar profile to Midway Point of Roast 1 but continue to the start of 2nd Crack (and thereby resulting in a longer development time).

Roast 3: Roast coffee to the same profile to First Crack, then end at the same color with a longer development time (over 4 mins).

Roast 4: Roast coffee to the same profile to First Crack, then end at the same color with a shorter development time (under 1:30).

Roast 5: Roast coffee to the same profile to First Crack, then end at the same color with a 2-3 minute development time.
