# Three Burner Types

* Atmospheric burner (gas burner)  
* Electric burner (like toaster oven)  
* Infrared burner (ceramic plates in BBQ grill)

???
Electrical burners possible on small (batch size 12 and less) roasters. 

Electrical heating elements are slow but are fine for roasting. 

Electricity always drives motors and general control circuits. 

---
# Heat Transfer Methods

* Convective  
* Conductive  
* Radiative

Related:

* Endothermic  
* Exothermic

???
* Two most common: convective and conductive. 
* Convective involves moving air. 
* Conductive requires physical contact and a temperature gradient. Drum rotation important here

Radiated heat example: the light emitted from a red-hot heating element in a toaster

Keywords:
Convection
Conduction
Endothermic
Exothermic

<a data-fancybox="gallery" data-selectable="true" data-caption="" href="/images/roaster-maintenance.jpeg"><img src="/images/roaster-maintenance.jpeg" alt="" width="50%" height="" align="right"></a>

* Create an emergency plan ahead of time
* Discuss the plan with everyone 
* Create a cleaning + maintenance plan
* Regularly review procedures and plans

# Personal Safety Concerns

**Four areas of concern:**

<a data-fancybox="gallery" data-selectable="true" data-caption="" href="/images/safety-personal-lifting.jpeg"><img src="/images/safety-personal-lifting.jpeg" alt="" width="40%" height="" align="left"></a>

* Green coffee storage
* Roasting
* Packaging, production
* Shipping

What are some concerns in these areas?

???
Loading coffee (heavy weight over head, maybe on stool, etc)

Smoke in roasting (ventilation, as smoke does escape the roaster into the room)
---
# Product Safety Concerns

**Same four areas of concern:**

* Green coffee storage
* Roasting
* Packaging, production
* Shipping

???
Seawater contamination during transport

Rocks in green coffee 
---
# Reacting to roaster fires

1. Relax and calm down
2. Shut off gas (or element if electric) 
3. Keep drum rotating
4. Can spray into charge door 
5. Don’t eject beans
6. Monitor bean temp, drop &lt; 93°C

# Movie time!

Marty Curtis has over 40 years experience in rebuilding Roasters & Pollution Control Equipment.

He attended training and put in the time necessary to know how to deal with Roasting System fires with safety in mind.

Anyone who watches these videos and thinks they are ready to do what Marty does are mistaken in their assumption.

Marty Curtis WILL NOT assume any liability, with anyone, who tries to intentionally create a roaster fire as depicted in these videos.

You assume ALL RISKS & LIABILITY for any actions you undertake in this regards.

Respectfully,

Marty G. Curtis CEO
Artisan Coffee Group Ltd

# Roaster Cleaning & Maintenance

* Remove chaff often (fuel source for fire)
  * Know where chaff collects in your roaster
  * At least daily, more for “chaffy” beans
* Keep ducts clear/clean (creosote & chaff)
* Keep moving parts lubricated (food grade grease)
* Follow manufacturer’s manual and recommendations

# How do you handle a fire in the roaster?

--

1\. Relax and calm down

--

2\. Shut off gas (or element if electric)

3\. Keep drum rotating

4\. Can spray into charge door

--

5\. Don't eject beans

6\. Monitor bean temp. Drop when below 93°C

# Physical changes in the bean

* Dries out
* Progressively darkens
* Becomes increasingly brittle
* First Crack
* Size can increase 30 - 100%
* Second crack
* Eventually oil seeps out (especially beyond second crack)
* Sometimes get divots (can be a roast defect)
* Rapid cooling (≤ 4min) to halt chemical reactions (changes)
    
???
Discuss free water. The Vapor wall or bubble. 

Discuss exothermic flashes

Contributes to the flick and crash 

With slow cooling: less acidity, increased baked flavors
---
# First Crack and Second Crack

* Every *successful* roast has a first crack
* First crack is the result of rapid release of pent-up vapor/steam pressure and CO2
* Not all roasts reach second crack (operator’s preference)
* Exothermic flashes as escaping heat affects environment

# Roast Data

Measurements that can be collected from green and roasted coffee:

1. Green: batch weight
2. Green: bulk density
3. Green: volume
4. Green: screen size
5. Green: moisture content (acceptable range for Specialty?)
6. Roasted: color
7. Roasted: weight\* 
8. Roasted: bulk density\*
9. Roasted: volume\*


Cupping data should be associated with roast profile for post-roast analysis.

# World Coffee Research Lexicon

The terms used in the new flavor wheel come from the WCR lexicon.

**Descriptive**

* No “good” or “bad” attributes (unbiased)
* Not for ranking coffee
* Purely descriptive

**Quantifiable**

* Uses an intensity scale of 1 - 15
* Allows for easy comparison of two or more coffees

**Replicable**

* When used properly, tasters from all over the world will experience and describe the same coffee the same way

# Tests Overview

**Written test**

* Must score 60% or higher
* 40-minute time limit (30 + 10 due to language diff)
* Fill in the blank + multiple choice
---
# Tests Overview

**Practical test**

* 1 hour and 40 minutes (100 minutes) time limit

**Part A**

* 3 roasts to match target color
* Each roast has full profile provided (ex: next slide)
* Log all data (can fudge missing data post-roast)

**Part B**

* Accurately record relevant properties of the roasting process and calculate following from batch #3 of Part A:
 * Development time
 * Weight loss
 * Volume gain

* ID basic stages of roast visually (pull five color samples)
* ID basic stages of roast sensorially (red-light cupping)
---
# Practical Example

1. Preheat the roaster to an appropriate starting temperature as specified by the trainer (185°C).
2. Charge the roaster.
3. Keep the flame at 100% (120 mm/h20) throughout the roast.
4. Log time and temperature change through the roast.
5. Take out the following samples and note time and temperature for each sample on the roast log.
 * Yellow
 * Cinnamon
 * The start of first crack
 * The end of first crack
 * Start of second crack
6. End the roast when it matches the color sample provided by the trainer.
---
# Practical Recommendations

* Roasters have small triers. Check against color reference several times.
* Remember log completeness
* Produce all 5 sample references: yellow, cinnamon, etc.
* Produce a completed log for one roast. Calculate:
 * development time
 * weight loss
 * ~~volume~~ density

Will be using the simplified cupping form for hands-on activity and for the test.

You will not be tested on the form. But if you complete it you must turn it in.

Form to help you capture the sensorial profile of each coffee and to ID the roast stage sampled.

Remember the progression of the flavor wheel!

Click “on” button during pre-heat (enables probe reading)

Recording will start before its time to drop

Charge event recorded automatically

TP event recorded automatically

DE event recorded automatically

FC button must be clicked manually

Drop event recorded automatically

Recording stopped automatically
