# Three Burner Types

Atmospheric burner (gas burner)  
Electric burner (like toaster oven)  
Infrared burner (ceramic plates in BBQ grill)

# Roasting Plant Safety

**Three areas of concern:**

Fire  
Ventilation  
Personal safety  

* Create an emergency plan ahead of time
* Discuss the plan with everyone 
* Create a cleaning + maintenance plan
* Regularly review procedures and plans

---

# Roaster fires

1. Shut off gas (or element if electric)
2. Keep drum rotating
3. Don’t open roaster doors
4. Don’t eject beans

---

# Personal Safety Concerns

**Four areas of concern:**

* Green coffee storage
* Roasting
* Packaging, production
* Shipping

What are some concerns in these areas?

# Fire Classifications

* Class A  
Ordinary items (wood, paper, plastic, rags)
* Class B  
Flammable Liquids
* Class C  
Electrical equipment

---
.logo[![OSC logo](https://oilslick.github.io/caffeinated.training/images/logo-125px.png)]

# Roaster Cleaning & Maintenance

* Remove chaff often (fuel source for fire)
  * Know where chaff collects in your roaster
  * At least daily, more for “chaffy” beans
* Keep ducts clear/clean (creosote & chaff)
* Keep moving parts lubricated (food grade grease)
* Follow manufacturer’s manual and recommendations

# Physical changes in the bean

* Dries out
* Progressively darkens
* Becomes increasingly brittle
* First Crack
* Size can increase 30 - 100%
* Second crack
* Eventually oil seeps out (especially beyond second crack)
* Sometimes get divots (can be a roast defect)
* Rapid cooling (≤ 4min) to halt chemical reactions (changes)

# First Crack and Second Crack

* Every *successful* roast has a first crack
* First crack is the result of rapid release of pent-up vapor/steam pressure and CO2
* Not all roasts reach second crack (operator’s preference)
* Exothermic flashes as escaping heat affects environment

# Roast Data

Measurements that can be collected from green and roasted coffee:

1. Green: batch weight
2. Green: bulk density
3. Green: volume
4. Green: screen size
5. Green: moisture content (acceptable range for Specialty?)
6. Roasted: color
7. Roasted: weight\* 
8. Roasted: bulk density\*
9. Roasted: volume\*


Cupping data should be associated with roast profile for post-roast analysis.

\*Calculate percent changes for these attributes]

# Label the following on a typical roast profile

Charge  
Turning Point  
Color change: green to yellow  
First crack  
Second crack  
Roast End

# Roast Progression

* Lighter roasts highlight (preserve) acidity, enzymatic flavors/aromas

* Darker roasts emphasize chocolatey, nutty, bitter flavors/aromas

# Temperature Midway Point ≈ 75 Agtron

* New concept  
* Generates easy color to work/train with  
* Not meant to be a standard or a sweet spot regarding end product
