# Heat Transfer Methods

---
# Heat Transfer

* Heat = Thermal Energy
* Heat ≠ Temperature

Three types we're concerned with:
 * Conduction
 * Convection
 * Radiation

???
Heat is thermal energy inside a material. 

Heat always travels from hot to cold materials. 

Heat can be transferred by different methods and different methods affect the beans differently 

Heat is thermal energy, temperature is a measure of heat

Most dominant two forms in roasting: conduction & convection

---
.left-column[
 ## Conductive 
]
.right-column[
* Physical contact + temperature gradient
* Common cause of roast defects
* Temperature gradient inside the bean
 * Water content within bean transfers heat to bean center
]

???
Conduction is when materials touch each other and the heat diffuses from the hotter to the cooler body. 

Once the heat reaches the surface of the bean it is transferred inside the bean by diffusing from the hotter surface to the colder center which could lead to a color gradient inside bean 

Identify burned spots on coffee as marks of too aggressive contact heat transfer 

Water content is critical for conductive transfer. Too little water = too little heat conducted to inside bean. Less water = less steam = less pressure = lower intensity FC.

---
.left-column[
 ## Conductive
 ## Convective
]
.right-column[
* Air as a medium or vehicle
* Most common transfer method in drum and air roasters
* Greater the temp difference between air and bean greater the transfer (potential)
* Easiest for operator to control
* Three ways to control convection:
1. Change rate of airflow 
2. Change energy output of burner/element
3. Combination of both
]
???
Convection is thermal energy transfer by a liquid, in this case the gases in the roaster's internal environment

It is a special kind of contact heat transfer since heat is transferred when the hot air is in contact with the cooler bean. 

The magnitude of temperature difference between the air in spaces between beans and the beans themselves is the magnitude of convection heat transfer at any given stage of the roast 

Magnitude (besarnya) is difficult to measure directly but the delta ET - BT is one indication
---
.left-column[
 ## Conductive
 ## Convective
 ## Radiated
]
.right-column[
* Electromagnetic radiation (same as the sun)
* Some visible, some not
* Example: light from heat source, heat felt near a heat source
* Metal in roaster acts as a battery, storing energy as heat*
]
???
Radiation is electromagnetic rays naturally emitted from a heat source and converted into thermal energy in the material it reaches. It is the same radiation as sun light 

Radiation is not completely converted into thermal energy at the surface of the bean but there is an absorption gradient in the bean so some heat is added inside the bean without affecting the surface

# Heat Transfer, Supplemental

## Total Energy

Start thinking about roasting in terms of physics. 

1. Coffee roasting is a dynamic process that changes throughout the roast cycle.
2. There is infinitely more energy later in the process than earlier.
3. None of the forms of heat transfer are independent of one another.

.footnote[
Terry Davis, "The Heat is On, A Roaster's Guide To Heat Transfer," Roast Magazine May/June 2009]

???
In roasting, the work we're doing is to impart chemical and physical changes to the beans. 

To do work, we need energy. In roasting the main source of energy is heat, which is used to drive chemical reactions and physical changes.

Think of the roaster as a generator (of heat energy). 
---
# Coffee roasting is dynamic
## Important heat sources by roasting phase

1. Drum, Air, Bean
2. Air, Drum, Bean
3. Bean, Drum, Air

.footnote[
Terry Davis, "The Heat is On, A Roaster's Guide To Heat Transfer," Roast Magazine May/June 2009]

???
None of the heat transfer forms are independent of one-another.

While it’s difficult to control any single form, it is very useful to know which method is dominate at which stage of the roast.

ET drives BT

There is infinitely more heat available at the end of the roast.

---
# Drum, Air, Bean

* Stored energy is critical here
 * Energy stored in metal parts
 * ...especially the drum
 * High potential for roast defects (scorching, tipping, uneven roast, etc)
* How can we control the temp here?

.footnote[
Terry Davis, "The Heat is On, A Roaster's Guide To Heat Transfer," Roast Magazine May/June 2009]

???
Once the roast begins, very little ability to control conduction

However, during preheat, the operator can set the stage

Higher charge temp = more potential energy stored as heat

Longer/more thorough preheat = more potential energy stored as heat

BT/ET/XT all indicate air temp before roast begins. Airtemp is affected by stored heat as well as burner/element.

Remember with partial/smaller batches to reduce the charge temp!

---
# Air, Drum, Bean

* Air is always dominate form
* However, during the second phase we control the Maillard reaction rate largely via air temp
 * (Maillard reaction rate increases with more heat)
* Convection is the easiest transfer method for operators to control

.footnote[

name: beandrumair
# Bean, Drum, Air

* In the third phase (beginnning with FC)  the beans become exothermic
 * Can become dominant form of heat transfer
 * How can one maintain control here?

Symptoms of too much heat at first crack:

0. Higher than normal* RoC 
1. Uneven roasting (too much momentum)
2. Unusual amounts of smoke 
3. Little to no pause between FC and SC

.footnote[
Terry Davis, "The Heat is On, A Roaster's Guide To Heat Transfer," Roast Magazine May/June 2009]

???
Anticipating exothermic conditions and reducing power early

"[R]oasting starts becoming exothermic at around 135ºC TB and is markedly exothermic when TB = 190ºC" (Schwartzberg 2013 "Batch coffee roasting; roasting energy use; reducing that use")

However; "TB profiles for both industrial and experimental roasting usually do not appear to be noticeably
affected by exothermic heating."

Increasing airflow may help reduce momentum here

Also remember that the harder we push the beans towards the end, the harder our cooler must work to cool the beans upon ejection. The beans can continue to roast in the cooling tray.

# What is it?

## Temperature Midway Point ≈ 75 Agtron

* Relatively new concept in SCA training
* Generates easy reference color to work/train with
* Not meant to be a standard or a sweet spot regarding end product

# The Roasting Cycle

---

# The Roasting Cycle
## What is it?

* Drying (evaporation)
* Color development (via multiple means)
* FC and beyond 
* Cooling Time


* Roast defects?

???
Evaporation takes heat energy to proceed. Pyrolysis creates heat energy. 

Up to **13-22%** mass lost during roast; most of the starting moisture. 

Even if the same coffee is roasted to the same roast color you can get very different sensorial results if the shape and timing of the roast profile is different. 

Roasting 'Defects' are worst case deviation from 'nice' profile. Cooling time should practically be as short as possible 

Discuss aspects of roast defects (scorched, baked, underdeveloped)

---
name: drying

# Drying (evaporation)

* Primary concern of first-third of roast? Maybe not? 
 * Evaporative cooling 
* Occurs throughout roast cycle at an increasing rate

![mass loss](/images/mass-loss.png)

.footnote[
Schwartzberg, Henry. (2013). Batch Coffee Roasting; Roasting Energy Use; Reducing That Use. 10.1007/978-1-4614-7906-2_10.]

???
Moisture leaves the beans during drying and goes from bean to the air between the beans that will become moist and get a higher specific heat capacity. 

“materials with large heat capacities, like water, hold heat well - their temperature won't rise much for a given amount of heat - whereas materials with small heat capacities, like copper, don't hold heat well - their temperature will rise significantly when heat is added” http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/mod_tech/node73.html

Evaporation is an endothermic process. 

Water is a heat sink—energy used to boil it could otherwise be used to roast coffee. 

Espresso machines utilize water as a temperature stabilizer because of waters high heat capacity. 

---

# Color development (roasting)

* Maillard reaction (actually a complex set of reactions)
 * Melanoidins
* Sugar caramelization
* Streker degradation (another complex)

.center[Much more on this tomorrow]

???
The Mailliard reaction and Strecker degradation are the main contributors to CO2 formation. ↑CO2 = ↑internal bean pressure

---

# First Crack and Beyond

* Typically signals the third phase of a roast profile
* What is first crack?
* An illustrative video: [Roasted 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2s7iJJ7zDo) by Kávékalmár
* Ways to anticipate it?
* Reasons to anticipate it?

???
Most major size expansion happens post FC.

Beans go exothermic here and can theoretically affect the environment temp.

Can manifest in RoC

Must be vigilant here—things happen fast in a short period of time

Maillard RX and sugar caramelization are happening readily and rapidly at these temps (180°C+)
 
[Roasted 3 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2s7iJJ7zDo)
---
name: cooling

# Cooling 

* Beans are still roasting when we eject them
* remember [Bean, Drum, Air](#beandrumair)
 * More aggressive cooling = better control over stopping-point of roast
* Ways to improve cooling time?
* Ideally want to cool to room temp in ≤ 4 minutes
 * Why?
???
By the third phase, the beans become a source of heat, even when ejected into the cooling tray.

Can often "drift" into second crack in the cooling tray (this could be intentionally done).
---

# Rate of Change

* Often called Rate of Rise (but temp may not always rise)
* Momentum (speed) of the roast
* Typically measured in 30 or 60-second intervals
* Not useful until after TP
* 30s is more accurate than 60s calculations
* Just another tool (but a handy one)
* As profiling software improves, so does RoC's usefulness

???
Changes to RoC are more quickly obvious than changes to BT

Drastically dropping RoC can cause *baked* coffee

Probe thickness determines accuracy and timeliness of RoC, especially re: the crash 

---

# Calculating Rate of Change

Example:  
At 4:00 temp is 148°C  
At 4:30 temp is 153°C

The temperature increased 5° in thirty seconds

153° - 148° = 5°

Therefore, RoC is 5°/30s  

Or if we want a more accurate/higher resolution RoC we could calculate the rate of change per second:

153° - 148° = 5°  
Time = 30s

5/30 = .16°/s (not very useful, in my opinion)

---

#RoC Visualized

![artisan profile](/images/artisan-profile.jpg)

# Quick Review

* How much mass is typically lost during the roast and what is most of the ‘material’ that is lost?
* Which occurs first (and thus longest); Strecker degradation or the Maillard reactions?
* Why are darker roasts less acidic?

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Basic properties and physical changes

---

# Observable changes

* Coffee is organic!
* Endothermic VS exothermic reactions

Important changes to observe and measure:

* Temperature over time
* Volume
* Weight
* Color
* Density
???
In the next activity, we're working to recognize the visually observable changes that take place during the roast cycle. 

This is another tool. Old school roasters roasted by sight and smell.  Some contend this is the best way. It is certainly a great way to learn the process and your machine but sight and smell are nuanced, subjective, and easily affected by many things (indv. anatomy, genetics, colds, mood, weather, culture, etc). 

Really geek out: [Cultural transmission results in convergence towards colour term universals](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.2012.3073)

Think of the difficulty of accurately defining the exact onset of first crack. Is it the first pop, two pops, many pops?

Hard data is king (but not perfect). Combine sensory observation with telemetry for best results.

 
---
class: middle

#Activity: Visual ID Roast Stages

* Take note of what each stage looks like
* Compare stages and visually understand the progression
* Things to note:

1. Color
2. Bean surface (Is it smooth? Is it wrinkled?)
3. Move the trays around and compare different stages side-by-side
4. Size comparison (At what stage does size begin to dramatically change?)
???
This activity is about navigation. How the beans look and smell in the tryer is where we are. What they'll look and smell like at our target roast point is where we're going. 


---

# Temperature over time

* Temperature evolution
* Typically includes bean and air or environment temp  (BT & ET)
* Momentum (Rate of change or rate of rise)
???
A roast profile is a graph showing temperature evolution over time typically for Bean and Air temperature. 
 
---

# Volume Changes

* Cell walls become brittle
* Water vapor inside bean creates a vapor “wall”*
* CO2 build-up
* Other organic gasses
???
Volume increases due to material softening from heat application combined with water evaporating into steam and pyrolysis creates organic gasses + CO2 within the bean. 

Pressure is built-up by the evaporating water that will later be the primary driver of bean swelling. If this part is too slow (too low flame) the gases could leak before creating a pressure high enough to expand the bean and the coffee will be 'underdeveloped'. 

If this part is too quick (too high flame) the surface of the bean will be scorched. 

Beans can swell to **30 - 100%** in size
---

# Weight Changes

* Weight difference is a critical measurement
* Weigh coffee before and after roasting and calculate % weight loss
* Density change is also a good measurement to track consistency

Remember:

![mass loss](/images/mass-loss.png)

???
Water in form of vapour and organic material is lost when converted into gas that leaves the material 

---

# Color changes

* Sugar browning
* Melanoidins
* Industry standards for color measurement
???
Melanoidins, a product of the Maillard RX are brown.  Maillard RX happens readily after drying is finished—slightly above 100° Celsius. 

Know different industry standards for measuring colour. 

Discuss color meters and how they work (emitting light and evaluating/measuring the wavelength of reflected light)

Some measure wavelength as well as reflection intensity 

Browning starts at **140°C**

---

# Sugar Changes

* Simple sugars already present in green bean
* Broken down and used later to form polysaccharides
* Caramelization
* Maillard VS Caramelization
???
Caramelization happens at high temperature (closer to 140-160° Celsius) so the Maillard reaction is much more pronounced due to it's lower activation temperature 
---

# Acidity Changes

* Acids formed early in roast
* Get reduced later in roast
* Therefore acidity provides information on roast level

.center[
More on acids tomorrow!]
???
Acids are formed very early in the process but starts to get reduced when entering into commercially relevant roast degrees

# Workspace Management

---

# Workspace Management

Green coffee storage, ideal conditions:

* 60% relative humidity
* Green beans at 10-12% moisture content  (12% = longest shelf life with 60% relative humidity)
* Keep bags ~15cm off floor, away from pests, water, etc
* Routinely check and monitor condition of stored greens
* Oxygen and water are key staling agents—control them.

---

# Workspace Management

Ideal safety conditions
* Production flow
  * Efficiency, organization in layout & movement
  * Physical safety/health (heavy lifting)
* Air quality while roasting
  * Big roasting machine (20+Kg) consider a mask
  * When handling greens consider a mask
  * Not just gases, but micro-fibers & micro-particles from greens 
* Fire safety
 * Fire suppression
 * Plan for a roaster fire
 * Share the plan with everyone
 * Revisit the plan regularly (at least yearly)

# Electricity

* Electric roasters are fine for sample roasting or lab roasting.
* Electrical heating elements are slow and don’t scale well

Question: how would you compensate for the lag caused by an electrical heating element?

---

# Tools for roasting

* Buckets + shovel/scoop
* Logging sheets or software
* Timer and temperature probes
* Infrared thermometer can be helpful
* Moisture, density, and roast color meters are handy  (and getting cheaper and smaller)
* Quality Control System (what does this look like?)
*A roaster (obviously)
???

You need to organize your work place so that you can store green and roasted coffee in containers with full batch traceability. 

Ergonomic tools for handling coffee. 

You need a quality control system either manual pen-and-paper or logging software. 

You need basic lab equipment to monitor quality of green and roasted coffee.roaster.

# Today's Roasting Activity

Roast 1: Perform roast to the start of 2nd Crack. Calculate TMP. 

Roast 2: Perform roast with any profile to Temperature Midway Point (sample color creation).

Roast 3: Roast coffee similar to #2, to First Crack, then end at the same color, ± 5 Ag,  with a longer development time (over 4 mins).

Roast 4: Roast coffee similar to #2 to First Crack, then end at the same color, ± 5 Ag, with a shorter development time (under 1:30).

Roast 5: Roast coffee similar to #2 to First Crack, then end at the same color, ± 5 Ag, with a 2-3 minute development time.

Roast 6: Duplicate roast #2 and achieve the same color, .red[± 4 Ag], with the same profile (within 5 seconds per phase)

---

# It's all about consistency

These activities are designed to illustrate a few things. 

1. Control is king
2. Roasts with different profiles but the same color can be very different in the cup
3. Your ability to consistently repeat a roast profile demonstrates control

Tips for success:

* In the first roasts, pay attention to the response time of the machine
 * Knowing how responsive it is allows you to better correct a straying profile
* Remember the visual ID activity to know where you are and where you are going 
* Have fun!
