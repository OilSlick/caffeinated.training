#Overview of a scientific paper

* Published in scientifc journals
* Typically (hopefully) reviewed by peers 
* But can be "pre-print" which means not yet reviewed
---
# Publication and peer review

* It is the job of the reviewer to critically assess the claims made in the paper
* Reviewers can give feedback and suggest edits
* The publisher of the journal decides to accept or reject the paper after review
---
# More on peer review

* Does not mean the work is correct or conclusive!
* Does mean it met the standards of science
* Two primary purposes:
1. To act as a filter of research quality
2. Improve quality of manuscripts suitable for publication

---
# More on peer review

Three types:

1. Open review
2. Single-blind → most common → reviewer anonymous, author known
3. Double-blind

Now back to papers...

	<strong>Abstract</strong>

<P>BACKGROUND: The occurrence of diseases can alter coffee (Coffea arabica L.) metabolism, causing changes in the composition of coffee beans and beverage quality. However, little is known about which aspects of coffee quality are actually altered by rust (Hemileia vastatrix Berk et Br.) and by its main control methods. The effect of chemical and genetic methods for the control of coffee rust on the quality of coffee beans and beverage was investigated.</P>

<P>RESULTS: Both genetic and chemical control reduce the damage caused by the disease in the composition of coffee beans. Genotypes with resistant ancestry, even with resistance breakdown, respond better to chemical control. The combination of genetic and chemical control favors an increase in the sugar content in the beans.</P>

<P>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that both genetic and chemical control are effective in reducing disease damage regarding the chemical composition of beans, the quality potential of Timor Hybrid genotypes associated with the cancellation of rust expression through the joint action of genetic and chemical control favors the composition of beans and, consequently, the quantitative assessment of sensory attributes, adding value to the final product.</P>

# The Introduction

* Briefly discusses the general topic
* May summarize the relevant work already done on the topic

Example paragraph:

<blockquote>Given the above, the objective of the study reported here was to verify the effect of chemical and genetic methods for the control of coffee rust, as well as their interaction, on different aspects related to coffee quality, from chemical and physicochemical composition and granulometry, to the sensory evaluation of the beverage. It is expected to find changes within each of these quality parameters that can support the decision of the producer regarding the genotype and disease management adopted, especially when it is desired to add value to the coffee product through differentiation and quality.</blockquote>

# Methods and matierials 

* Describes the methodology in detail
* Describes what data was collected and how 
* Describes in detail any experiments conducted
* Describes statistical methodology, kinds of analyses

Example paragraph:

<blockquote>The experiment was carried out in 2018–2019, at the Germplasm Active Bank of Coffea spp. of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in the Experimental Field of Patrocínio (CEPC), located at 18°5902600 south latitude, 48°580 9500 west longitude and 975 m altitude, in the Cerrado Mineiro Region, 1st Coffee Designation Origin in Brazil. The soil is a Red Latosol and the topography is flat, with a slight slope.</blockquote>

and...

<blockquote>Experimental precision was measured by estimating the experimental coefficient of variation (CV%). The means were grouped by the Scott–Knott test (P < 0.05) when a significant effect of factor was identified by the analysis of variance.</blockquote>

# Results

* Describes the outcome
* Often the most statistics-heavy section
---
# Discussion

* Where the authors can interpret their results
* The most subjective portion of the paper
* "There is rarely a single objective way in which to interpret reported results."
* This section should be critically assessed
