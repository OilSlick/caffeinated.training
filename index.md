This is an archive of presentation decks and instructional material from previous classes I have taught. 

Because the SCA requires instructors to develop their own instructional material, I might not have included all of the slides or images that were presented in a given class. 

While I try to ensure that the slides aren't the primary source of information, often they areâ€”and that's a good thing. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="" href="https://mccleskeyms.typepad.com/files/what-reading-does-for-the-mind.pdf">Reading has positive cognitive consequences</a>.

Below are links to class material in reverse chronological order (most-recent first). 

If you are taking an SCA Roasting Foundation course, you can use my <a target="_blank" title="" href="/foundation-study-v1.html">study guide</a> to get a jump on the class. You may also benefit from reading several of the articles I have organized <a target="_blank" href="http://oilslickcoffee.com/roasting/">on my blog</a>.
