This is an archive of presentation decks and instructional material from previous classes I have taught. 

Because the SCA requires instructors to develop their own instructional material, I might not have included all of the slides or images that were presented in a given class. 

While I try to ensure that the slides aren't the primary source of information, often they areâ€”and that's a good thing. [Reading has positive cognitive consequences](https://mccleskeyms.typepad.com/files/what-reading-does-for-the-mind.pdf).
